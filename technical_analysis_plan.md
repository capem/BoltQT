## Detailed Technical Analysis Plan for Tkinter Application

**Phase 1: Information Gathering and Understanding**

1.  **Explore Project Structure:** List files in the current directory to understand the project layout.
    - Tool: `list_files`

2.  **Examine `main.py`:** Read the main application file to understand the application's entry point and overall structure.
    - Tool: `read_file`

3.  **Investigate UI Files:** Read UI files (`src/ui/*.py`) to understand UI components and structure.
    - Tool: `read_file`
    - Focus on:
        - `config_tab.py`: Configuration settings for source folder, Excel file, and filters.
        - `processing_tab.py`: Main processing logic, PDF display, and filter interaction.

4.  **Analyze Utility Files:** Examine utility files (`src/utils/*.py`) to understand data model and core logic.
    - Tool: `read_file`
    - Focus on:
        - `config_manager.py`: Loading, saving, and managing configuration settings.
        - `excel_manager.py`: Excel file operations, data loading, and hyperlink management.
        - `pdf_manager.py`: PDF processing, file handling, and rotation.
        - `template_manager.py`: Template parsing and processing for output file naming.
        - `models.py`: Data models, specifically the `PDFTask` class.

5.  **Clarifying Questions:** Ask the user clarifying questions to ensure complete understanding.
    - Tool: `ask_followup_question`
    - Questions:
        - What is the primary purpose of the File Organizer application?
        - What specific types of files does it process, and what is the expected output?
        - Is there a specific reason for migrating to PyQt6, such as performance improvements, cross-platform compatibility, or access to specific PyQt6 features?
        - Does the application support updating existing data in a row?

**Phase 2: Detailed Analysis and Documentation Plan**

6.  **Detailed Analysis Plan Creation:** Create a detailed plan for technical analysis. (This step - Architect mode)

7.  **User Review and Approval of Analysis Plan:** Get user approval for the analysis plan.
    - Tool: `ask_followup_question`

8.  **PyQt6 Migration Plan Development:** Develop a comprehensive PyQt6 migration plan. (Next phase - Architect mode)

9.  **User Review and Approval of Migration Plan:** Get user approval for the migration plan.
    - Tool: `ask_followup_question`

10. **Plan Documentation:** Write the analysis and migration plans to a markdown file.
    - Tool: `write_to_file`

11. **Mode Switch Request:** Request to switch to Code mode for implementation.
    - Tool: `switch_mode`

**Detailed Analysis Steps:**

1.  **Execution Flow Analysis**: Trace application startup, main loop, and shutdown. (Tools: `read_file`)
    - Focus on `main.py` and the initialization of UI components and managers.

2.  **Technical Architecture Documentation**: Document modular structure and class relationships. (Tools: `list_code_definition_names`, `read_file`)
    - Use `list_code_definition_names` to identify classes and functions in each module.
    - Use `read_file` to examine class relationships and dependencies.

3.  **Core Functionality Definition**: Define primary purpose and core features. (Method: Code review and task description review)
    - Focus on data entry, linking PDFs, and updating Excel.

4.  **Event-Driven Interactions Analysis**: Trace event flow, data transformations, and UI state changes for user interactions. (Tools: `read_file`)
    - Focus on button clicks, combobox selections, and filter updates in `config_tab.py` and `processing_tab.py`.

5.  **Data Model Documentation**: Detail data structures, persistence mechanisms, and data flow. (Tools: `read_file`)
    - Focus on the `PDFTask` class in `models.py` and data handling in `excel_manager.py` and `config_manager.py`.

6.  **UI State Management Strategy**: Describe UI state management and update mechanisms. (Method: Code review)
    - Focus on how UI elements are updated in response to configuration changes and data loading.

7.  **Validation Rules Documentation**: Document input validation rules, triggers, and errors. (Tools: `search_files`, Code review)
    - Use `search_files` to find validation logic in `config_tab.py` and `processing_tab.py`.

8.  **I/O Operations and External Dependencies**: Document file I/O, external libraries, and network calls. (Tools: `search_files`, Code review)
    - Use `search_files` to identify file I/O operations and external library usage in `excel_manager.py` and `pdf_manager.py`.

9.  **Layout Management and UI Hierarchy**: Describe layout strategy and widget hierarchy. (Tools: `read_file`)
    - Focus on the use of `grid` and other layout managers in `config_tab.py` and `processing_tab.py`.

10. **Conceptual Model Construction**: Synthesize analysis into a conceptual model with diagrams and explanations. (Method: Documentation consolidation and diagram creation)
